DataPad user management
=====

DataPad is going to have users in groups
with credentials for third-party services.
We need some way of managing that. The
present repository presents a story about
what we'll need to represent. Then it
discusses how to implement it with a few
different services.

## Services
Here are the services I looked at. This is
a pretty broad range, and it includes things
that are totally off the mark; I included
these so that we can quickly remember later
not to use them.
